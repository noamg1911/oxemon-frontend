# `oxemon` Frontend

This is the frontend side of the glorious oxemon.<br>
It is an easy-to-operate framework for defining and viewing metrics of data generated using `oxemon agent`.

## TL;DR

### Prerequisites

- `docker` and `docker-compose`
- Some tool to run `Makefile`s (only relevant for Windows)
- You need to have `python3` installed

### 0. Initial Setup

⚠️ This needs to be done only once (re-run when updating to newer versions of `oxemon-frontend`).

1. Clone this repo (`oxemon-frontend`) and `cd` into it.
1. In this folder, run
```bash
make build
```

### 1. Configuration

⚠️ This needs to be done everytime you add `emit` calls in your code (which changes the dictionary) or when you want to update your metrics configurations.

1. Get the path to your `oxemon_dictionary.json` file (auto-generated by the oxemon agent).
2. Write a [metrics configuration](#metrics-configuration) for your project.
3. From this folder, run
```bash
make config dictionary=<path/to/oxemon_dictionary.json> metrics=<path/to/metrics.yaml> output=<output/folder>
```

### 2. Start

⚠️ This starts/stops the servers, and they should be restarted whenever the configuration is changed.

To start/stop the servers, simply run
```bash
make start CONFIG_FOLDER=<path/to/oxemon/configuration/folder>
make stop
```

_Do you want to support cool reinitialization without taking down the servers? You're more than welcome to iplement this feature and open a Pull Request._
